1:Manasu nirmalambe manchiki margambu Pure mind leads to goodness Manasu nirmalambe mahitha shakthi Pure mind is the mighty power Nirmalambu manase neeradi mutyavu Pure mind is the pearl of the great ocean of life One needs to dwell on the pearl from where does one get the pearl Is it found on trees Does it crop out of the earth No it is got from ocean alone What is this ocean The ocean is the ocean of life In this very ocean of life one can find the pearls The body is like the shell the pearl of atma resides in the shell called the body. The pearl is white and shines bright That is atma nirgunam niranjanam sanathanam nikethanam nithya sudha budha muktha nirmala swaroopinam the pure one There is no other entity which is as effulgent as pure and as sacred as the atma Though atma does not have legs nothing can move faster than it The atma does not have hands but it can hold everything. The atma does not have eyes there is nothing that it cannot see Love is the only path to understand and get hold of such atma That love exists as rasa swaroopam the life fluid in all The poets describe it as the Nava rasa nine life fluids but there exists only two rasas life fluids One is karuna rasamu compassion and the other is soka rasam misery or sorrow All the rest of the rasas are found in these two The Karuna Rasa compassion is the rasa of love Once one has the rasa of love one has God That is why Swami says Love is God Live in love
