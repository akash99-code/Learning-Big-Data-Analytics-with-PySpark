4:Who is the human being Where from he has come Divinity is the source Suppose we have piled up some iron pieces at one place silver scrap at another place copper filings at another place diamond waste at one place and gold gangue at another place and placed a magnet amidst them What will happen Iron pieces flock towards the magnet because it has the power of attracting iron and not the other materials despite their higher value Iron pieces have no legs no wings and no rope attached Yet they move towards the magnet because of the power of attraction wielded by the magnet Atma Tattwa is akin to the magnet It is Atma that makes life vibrant and the world functional We should put in sincere efforts to understand such Atma Tattwa
