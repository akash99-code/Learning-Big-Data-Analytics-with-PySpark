9:Youngsters As Bhagawan said in the beginning character is the most important thing No one can excel the one whose character behaviour and conduct are perfect When ten of the youngsters go to a village for service how should they conduct themselves They should be very silent peaceful and with a smile One can smile but should not laugh loudly They should not talk loudly disturbing the environment When one gives in to the loud banter and laugh the villagers may think that a gang of rowdies has come to their village and will be fear stricken So they should not get a bad name So they should go with all humility and not engage in loud talk or bad looks When one starts to work there would be no need to talk The one who talks will not work The one who works will not talk One should always remember this A true worker will not talk while working for one cannot work while talking Therefore one should start a new chapter and learn to live purposefully hereafter
