2:Man thinks that it is the eye that sees a particular scene No The eye is lifeless inert Who is the one that sees It is the atma that sees There are the bulbs that glow in the car One may think that it is the bulbs that glow but it is the current flowing in the bulbs that makes them glow It is similar with the ears one hears the sound from the loud speakers and thinks that the loud speakers are the basis for the sound emanating from it But the moment the flow of current stops the loud speakers go mute So here too it is the current that is the basis for the sound The ears can be compared to the loudspeakers and it is because of the current called atma that the ear is able to hear The tongue which speaks is like a mike which is useless without the current flow Hence it is the atma that is the basis for all the senses Without mentioning the name of atma the scientists today say it is a power or energy This energy too is a form of power Energy is useless without matter Just as energy is useless without matter so also matter is useless without energy
