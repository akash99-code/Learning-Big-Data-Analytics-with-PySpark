5:Though atma does not have legs nothing can move faster than it The atma does not have hands but it can hold everything The atma does not have eyes there is nothing that it cannot see Love is the only path to understand and get hold of such atma That love exists as Rasa Swaroopam the life fluid in all The poets describe it as the Nava rasa nine life fluids but there exists only two rasas life fluids One is karuna rasamu compassion and the other is Soka rasam misery or sorrow All the rest of the rasas are found in these two The Karuna rasa compassion is the rasa of love Once one has the rasa of love one has God That is why Swami says Love is God Live in love Man should live with such love Years may roll by seasons may change wars may take place but with just a drop of Lords grace man can overcome anything
