3:Therefore in this world the atmic life is most important The lives lived through the body mind or through intelligence are no lives at all Wasting time in sustaining the body and ultimately perishing with time has become the main routine for man Influenced by the space and time man is unable to realise the truth of life From dawn to dusk man is engaged in enquiring about several things in the world and in reading the texts but what is it that man has understood and gained Man is not gaining any knowledge All that one understands is useless because it gives momentary satisfaction and leads to dissatisfaction in the long run It is like a mirage One may follow the mirage endlessly but it will not quench ones thirst The mirage is not water but looks like water Therefore the happiness prosperity luxuries and comforts that one experiences in this physical world seem like the true happiness But these are not true experiences of happiness or bliss If it is true happiness that one experiences in the physical world then it must give permanent happiness But man experiences happiness and comfort one moment and sorrow in the next moment
